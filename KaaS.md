# Knowledge as a Service (KaaS)

'Data is the new oil' is ok, but raw oil is useless unless it is refined for end purpose. So, refining or curating data is the key, mainly for downstream applications such as training Machine/Deep Learning algorithms.

Algorithms is commodity, (curated) data is gold, a refined oil. Plus it is hard to keep up with advancements in algorithms, not manageable, but need for curated data is high and going to be there forever, an IKIGAI.

Data curation companies are in abundance and each ML company anyways does it internally, but can it be made as a external, 
paid Service? On which datasets, in which usable-intermediate form? where to get raw datasets? privacy or ownership issues?


Data curation can be vast, labor intensive,  employment generation for review, multidisciplinary, business or social, etc. Need to build niche.

Build KG from texts. Its a Specific knowledge : Specialize is graphs, knowledge graphs, expertise in nlp for extraction from text,

KG itself is useful for insights using GQLs, but can also be used for predictions. But this is domain specific and labor/review intensive, especially the relationship extraction part.
Another thought is not to serve curated data as is but in binary/vector form, so hard to reverse engineering and privacy preserving.
So basically vector db access is what you are selling,  

IKIGAI:
- What world needs: ready-to-use data,for ML/DL
- What world is ready to pay for? easy access to curataed data, like HuggingFace or Kaggle
- What you like? Building KGs
- What you are good at? working in NLP/LLMs
