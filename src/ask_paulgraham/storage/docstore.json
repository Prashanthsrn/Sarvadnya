that this \u201cteacher\u2019s reference guide\u201d helps highlight the most impactful points from \nPaul Graham\u2019s essays. Paul Graham is best known for starting and selling a company called \nViaweb and later starting a new model for funding early stage startups called Y Combinator. His \nunique background of art, history, philosophy, and writing combined with his experience starting, \ngrowing, leading, selling and investing in startups gives him a fascinating and often surprising \noutlook on broad spectrum of topics. He is one of the few people to have deep fluency in nearly \nevery aspect pertinent to startups and has perhaps more experience and better pattern recognition \nthan anybody else.  \n \nSome key filters I consider in order to figure out what topics to focus on and dive into are \nuniversality and timelessness. It is worth spending the most time reading, analyzing, understanding \nand acting upon the things which don\u2019t change, or at least change relatively slowly.

So this is not about whether it's ok to kill killers. This is about whether \nit's ok to kill innocent people. A child could answer that one for you.
