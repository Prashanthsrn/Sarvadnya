# Ask Manim

Text 2 Mathematics Animation tool

## ðŸ›  Core Development

Steps:
- Build UI^ with streamlit, it will have following components
	- Title, subtitle having mentions of 360macky and manim grant sanderson
	- Text box for prompt, 'Generate' button
	- Text area (not box) for displaying generated manim code (later can be made editable)
	- Video area to display it
- Use UI with ready LLM as is, see how code is displayed, how video is generated in the background and shown on UI
- Deploy to spaces for personal testing, it everything looks ok, go for fine-tuning
- fine-tuning:
	- Prepare data from jsonl to data-frame^
	- Use standard hugging face way of fine-tuning or Ludwig, run that model locally using LM studio
	
^Use prompt to generate the code, mention that prompt here as well

### ðŸ“¦ Installation


To start the app, run:

```
streamlit run streamlit_main.py
```
