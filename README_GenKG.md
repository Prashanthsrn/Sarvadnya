# Generating Knowledge Graphs

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for generating Knowledge Graphs from various data sources. Knowledge Graphs are powerful tools for organizing and representing information in a structured and machine-readable format, enabling advanced analytics, knowledge discovery, and decision-making.

## Usage

### Data Extraction
1. Implement data extraction functions to retrieve data from various sources (e.g., databases, CSV files, web APIs).
2. Preprocess the data as needed, such as cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for Knowledge Graph generation.

### Knowledge Graph Generation
1. Define the ontology or schema for your Knowledge Graph, specifying the entities, relationships, and properties.
2. Use the `rdflib` library to create RDF triples based on the extracted data and the defined ontology.
3. Store the RDF triples in a triplestore or a graph database for efficient querying and storage.

### Visualization
1. Leverage libraries like `networkx` and `matplotlib` to visualize the generated Knowledge Graph.
2. Provide options for customizing the visualization, such as node and edge styles, layout algorithms, and filtering.

## Configuration
1. Customize the data extraction and preprocessing steps to fit your specific use case.
2. Adjust the Knowledge Graph generation parameters, such as the ontology definition and the triplestore configuration.
3. Modify the visualization settings to meet your requirements.
