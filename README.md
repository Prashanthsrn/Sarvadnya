# Sarvadnya (सर्वज्ञ), an All-Knowing Chatbot!!

Chatbots have always been WoW stuff!! The recent evidence is: ChatGPT.

Now that they are more human-like with the latest LLMs (Large Language Models). But these LLMs are Pretrained on their own (HUGE) data. Mere mortals dont have any ways ($$, time, expertise) to train own LLMs.
Some do have facility to get fine-tuned on custom corpus, but limited. This repo explores this further. Wish to build that end-to-end MLOps for fine-tuning LLMs.

Goal: build fine-tuning on LLMs on own corpus:
- corpus can be documents: FAQs, manuals medical papers, etc (many tutorials are available to do this via Vector Databases)
- corpus can be tables, so need SQL/BI conversion from natural language
- corpus can be graphs: social networks, need conversion to GraphGPT, cypher

<!-- 
## Why me?
- Reasonable popularity due to Sketchnote and talks on ChatGPT or LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Specific Knowledge: Theoretical background of NLP/LLMs due to trainings, plus, professional experience on customizing LLMs on custom data, plus common-sense software solution-ing experience for 2 decades, including engineering industries. Rare-Global-Untrainable-Leverage-Brand.
- IKIGAI: I love, I like, World needs, Can get paid
 -->
## Approaches
- Open source: LangChain using HuggingFace free models (Open AI models are cheap also), for local, data-secure solution
- Google Cloud: End-yo-end VertexAI MLOps, easy deployment, for enterprise internal solution.
