# Sarvadnya (सर्वज्ञ), an All-Knowing Micro SaaS!!

Chatbots can be real WoW!! The recent evidence is: ChatGPT. Now that they are more human-like with the latest LLMs (Large Language Models). But these LLMs are Pretrained on their own (HUGE) data. Mere mortals don't have any ways ($$, time, expertise) to train own LLMs.
Some do have facility to get fine-tuned on custom corpus, but limited. Custom fine tuning of text documents is being provided by many. Embarking on the journey to master the powerful and sought-after paradigm of RAG, along with multi-modal fine-tuning techniques and Knowledge Graphs. The combination of LLM and RAG (with KG) is an IKIGAI - a concept that the world needs, is willing to pay for, and something you are good at and enjoy. This aligns with Naval’s suggestion of cultivating ‘Specific Knowledge’ - a unique skill set that is untrainable and possessed by few.

This repo is a collection of various [PoCs (Proof-of-Concepts)](./src/README.md) to interface custom data using LLMs. Some notes [here](./Notes.md) 

# What?

## PoCs demos
- On various modalities, use cases and domains, for ChatBots
- Prep videos, write Medium Posts (GDE/TH), LinkedIn posts, Youtube channel, 
- Make a webpage and store them there as a portfolio, Opensource at Github [Contrary thought: Let me LinkedIn page itself be the webpage, no extra url to maintain]

## MicroSaaS
- Learn some end-to-end hosting platform (LangServe? Langchian with Azure AI?)
- Convert above demos to have user input (disclaimers, limited uploads, $$)

## Trainings
- Make intro videos of all the workshops and courses (use GDE video material)
- Show open source course material, always updating
<!-- Rates 25k/hr ($300) one time minimum, half if its weeklong, $90/h for long term, online ok, offline + travel -->

## Research
- MidcurveNN: graph to graph transformation learning
- Indic Languages: OCR for sharada scripts, tokenizer for Sanskrit


# Why?

## Chatbot on Own Data
- Fine-tuning LLMs with own data using LoRA etc
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on own data

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- WHY?: World needs, ready to pay, I am good at, and I like it making wow chatbots
- Domain:
	- on knowledge graphs, more grounding
	- tabular financial data, representation and similarity
	- midcurveNN Geometric serialisation and retrieval
	- active loop idea of fine-tuning your data
	- langchain and llamaindex with any new llm
	- bharat gpt, bhashini with sanskrit, do prototype on arthashastra principles
- Specific Knowledge - LLMs, Graphs, Sanskrit 

## Tech Stacks
- Enterprise: Google Doc AI, Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure Language AI Services
- Open Source: Langchain (Serve/Smith/Graph), HuggingFace, Streamlit for UI

## Why LangChain? Unofficial Developer Advocate
- Local (secure), no over-the-net API/web calls
- Open source, Free via HuggingFace, Contrib possible
- PoC to Prod, end-to-end
- Python!! end-to-end, with Streamlit as UI
- Huge support, community, opportunities
- Coach: write/talk about it via Medium Stories, Webinars, LinkedIn posts (Mvp ++, advocu ++)
- Passive MicroSaaS income, pay per use, Integrations

<!-- ## Why me?
- Need to be 'creating', time-based-jobs can't scale, its renting, need to leverage intellect
- MicroSaaS: one-person company, pay-per-use service for passive income forever
- Build out-of-the-world idea, a wow automation, using NLP LLM Gen AI.
- Find pressing pain points to address, in daily use, for wider audience
- Devote time playfully to solve the problem, with peace and joy, no anxiety no fomo, no hopes of revenue but just a journey to develop something very cool
- Reasonable popularity due to Sketchnote and talks on ChatGPT or LLMs (Large Language Models), will help the spread
- Specific Knowledge: Theoretical background of NLP/LLMs due to trainings, plus, professional experience on customizing LLMs on custom data, plus common-sense software solution-ing experience for 2 decades, including engineering industries. Rare-Global-Untrainable-Leverage-Brand.
- IKIGAI: I love, I like, World needs, Can get paid
	- World needs: huge corpus, global, domain
	- Good at: ML, NLP professional experience
	- Love doing: automation, part II
	- Paid for: consult, train, passive service

^Specific Knowledge: rare, un-trainable, only through apprenticeship 

## Manifestation
- Theme: Automation MicroSaas
- Product: Micro SaaS, auto upgrade, Serverless, scale as you go
- Payment: Pay per use, Passive Income, forever
- Income: Passive, remote fully, global reach
- Working: Solo, remote, no team, no HR issues, salaries
- Input: scraping , docAI(GDE)->KG (neo4j)
- Output: Wow chatbot, APIs, Network effects, more connection, more $$
- Moat/Entry Barrier, IKIGAI, Sp Knowledge
- Give back: Talks, sketchnotes, Tech explanations
- Side outcomes: consultancy, open source contribution  -->

## Checklist: MicroSaas
- Do you have unfair advantage: 
	- Network of founders, influences, for further reach 
	- Audience: folks who want this app and can pay
	- Being early
- Start With a Problem or many problems (don’t tell me your ideas)
- Move from Problems to Solutions, easy, debuggable
- Evaluate Your Solutions
- How is Your Solution Different?
- Talk to Potential Customers
- Start Marketing Before Coding
- Build MVP
- Solves any specific need (pain point) and not anything-and-everything, 
- Is it for specific people, 1000 true (paying) fans, say $30 or $3 a month
- Is it a daily need?

## LangChain MicroSaaS
1. **Focused Development**: Micro SaaS businesses focus on serving a niche market or a specific customer segment with a highly targeted software solution[^10^]. This allows for focused development and targeted marketing⁹.

2. **Cost-Effective**: Micro SaaS businesses operate with minimal resources, leveraging cloud infrastructure and automation tools to streamline operations and keep costs low[^10^]. RAG offers an affordable, secure, and explainable alternative to general-purpose LLMs, drastically reducing the likelihood of hallucination⁴.

3. **Customized Solutions**: RAG allows businesses to achieve customized solutions while maintaining data relevance and optimizing costs⁶. By adopting RAG, companies can use the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, utilizing their existing models to process and generate responses based on new data⁴.

4. **Integration with LangChain**: LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs¹. It can dynamically connect different systems, chains, and modules to use data and functions from many sources, like different LLMs¹. This allows businesses to develop language model-powered software applications that can carry out various activities, including code analysis, document analysis, and summarization².

5. **Data-Aware and Agentic**: LangChain is data-aware and agentic, enabling connections with various data sources for richer, personalized experiences³. This allows for better interoperability across the board, offering various valuable tools that allow businesses to connect to different vendors (including other LLMs) and integrations with a comprehensive collection of open-source components¹.

6. **Access to Various LLM Providers**: LangChain offers access to LLMs from various providers like OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, AI24labs, among others¹. These models can be accessed through API calls using platform-specific API tokens, allowing developers to leverage their advanced capabilities to build as they see fit¹.

7. **Recurring Profits and Low Risk**: With their recurring profits, fewer capital needs, low risk, dedicated customers and minimal operating expenses, Micro SaaS has started attracting many entrepreneurs towards them in recent years¹⁴.

8. **Stable Recurring Income**: Micro-SaaS businesses are usually location-independent and can be a source of stable recurring income once the product has achieved a loyal user base¹¹.
