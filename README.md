# Sarvadnya (सर्वज्ञ), an All-Knowing Micro SaaS!!

Chatbots can be real WoW!! The recent evidence is: ChatGPT. Now that they are more human-like with the latest LLMs (Large Language Models). But these LLMs are Pretrained on their own (HUGE) data. Mere mortals don't have any ways ($$, time, expertise) to train own LLMs.
Some do have facility to get fine-tuned on custom corpus, but limited. Custom fine tuning of text documents is being provided by many. 

This repo is a collection of various [PoCs (Proof-of-Concepts)](./src/README.md) to interface custom data using LLMs.

Stretch (RnD) goals: 
- [{KG + LLM} chatbot](./README_LLM_KG.md) Building LLM based Chatbot on Knowledge Graph
- [Knowledge as a Service (KaaS)](./README_KaaS.md) Building Knowledge Graph from Text and serving it as a Service
- LLM models for Indic (especially Sanskrit) languages. Here is collection of similar efforts going on [Awesome AI By Bharat (AABB)](./README_AABB.md)

## Pathways
- Enterprise: Google Cloud: Gen AI, Doc AI, Vertex AI: Skills Boost paths, Professional ML Certification
- Open Source: Langchain, HuggingFace, Streamlit: Custom fine-tuned models

## Why LangChain based Implementations ?:
- Local (secure), no over-the-net API/web calls
- Open source, Free via HuggingFace
- Python!! end-to-end, with Streamlit as UI
- Huge support, community, opportunities
