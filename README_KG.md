# Knowledge Graphs

This site is related to information extraction from text in the form of knowledge graphs and building Conversational AI front-end to it.

## Rational

No one person can read a million articles comping every day in Pubmed. So is the velocity with legal judgments, research papers in any domain. How to comprehend, at least superficially if not fully,  semantically? At least narrow down, ie filter to get to some core documents for further manual study. Use AI ML in NLP for Information Retrieval and Text Mining techniques. Applications vertically are in many domains but horizontally for Automation for QnA and Hypothesis Generation.

Chatbot would be the front-end for Knowledge Graph for "WoW!!" experience. Chatbot is Turing real AI even if its adding some incremental benefit.

Solution can be domain agnostic, highly portable, for global impact and sustainable forever.

तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय : From Dark (hidden in text data) to Light (insights)

Application: Health-care for Sr Citizen via Voice is the next best thing

## Contours
- Given text corpus (any domain: legal cases, medical papers, research articles, etc)
- Build Knowledge Graph with nodes/edges populated using:
	- Linguistic features: POS/NER tags, Topic Models, etc
	- Domain Knowledge: Ontologies, dictionaries
- All thru configurations
- Able to fire queries to find relations, paths between concepts, subgraphs, similarity, anomaly detection, etc.
- LangChain based chatbot as front end or it can be graph visualization tool for RnD kind of queries


Why LangChain:
- Local (secure), no over-the-net API/web calls
- Open source, Free
- Good integration with Voice Commands is the next big thing
- Python!!
- Huge support, community, opportunities

KG + LLM: IKIGAI/Sp Know^/Wow!!: 
- World needs: huge corpus, global, domain
- Good at: ML, NLP professional experience
- Love doing: automation, part II
- Paid for: consult, train, passive service

^Specific Knowledge: rare, un-trainable, only through apprenticeship 

## ToDos
-

## Application: Elderly care
- Elderly can not type at normal chatbot, ie on mobile (WhatsApp) or Web (messenger), they are technologically challenged.
- Need voice command based system. It need not process complex linguistics of literature quality, but a simple, unambiguous, voice command system.
- Single, elderly, living alone is the target persona. Needs daily routine check, medication reminder, ordering necessary items, basic first level medical assistance, do some entertainment, help call doctor/relatives, appointments etc.
- Hindi, vernacular for wider reach, global impact, issue I care and seeing with parents.
